## Getting Started

1. **Clone this project:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purinton/wx.git
   cd wx
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Discord app token, OpenAI key, and other secrets.
   - Edit `package.json` (name, description, author, etc.)
   - Update this `README.md` as needed.

3. **Start the app locally:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   node wx.mjs
   ```

## Configuration

- All configuration is handled via environment variables in the `.env` file.
- See `.env.example` for required and optional variables.
- For scheduled weather reports, edit `cron.json` (see `cron.json.example`).

## Running as a Service (systemd)

1. Copy `wx.service` to `/usr/lib/systemd/system/wx.service`.
2. Edit the paths and user/group as needed.
3. Reload systemd and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable wx
   sudo systemctl start wx
   sudo systemctl status wx
   ```

## Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t wx .
   ```

2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env wx
   ```

## Customization

### Commands

- Add new commands in the `commands/` directory.
- Each command has a `.json` definition (for Discord registration/localization) and a `.mjs` handler (for logic).

### Events

- Add or modify event handlers in the `events/` directory.
- Each Discord event (e.g., `ready`, `messageCreate`, `interactionCreate`) has its own handler file.

### Locales

- Add or update language files in the `locales/` directory.
- Localize command names, descriptions, and app responses.

## Testing

- Run tests with:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- Add your tests in the `tests/` folder or alongside your code.
